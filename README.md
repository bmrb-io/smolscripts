# smolscripts

Internal: processing scripts for creating metabolomics/small molecule BMRB entries from NMR facility data.

Some of this code is of more general use:
  * create BMRB entry for (carefully crafted) JSON,
  * create NMR-STAR molecule sections from SDF/MOL,
  * create molecule images from SFD/MOL. incl. UWSGI web insterface for that.
